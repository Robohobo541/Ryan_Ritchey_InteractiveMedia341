    <H1>How to Pet a Cat</H1>

    <p>Petting a cat may sound simple, but for children or people who haven't spent much time around cats, it's important to know the do's and don'ts of approaching and touching a cat. Petting in the wrong spot or using too much force or speed can agitate some cats, causing them to bite or scratch. Experts recommend letting it happen on the cat's terms: seek permission to touch them, and let the cat have control over the interaction. There are a few places where it's hard to go wrong: areas where cats have scent glands are perfect for petting. Spreading their scent imbues their environment with a familiar smell, which in turn makes them feel happy and content.[1] Knowing where to touch, and when to stay away, can help ensure that both of you enjoy a little cat-human contact.

            <h2>Focusing on Areas with Scent Glands</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Start with a soft chin-scratch. Use your fingertips or fingernails to gently rub the chin, particularly where the jawbone connects to the skull. It's possible the cat will push into your stroke or jut out his/her chin, both signs of enjoyment.[2] <div 3=""></div>

                    <p>
                        Focus on the area between or behind the ears. Use the pads of your fingers and apply gentle pressure. The base of the ears is another scent-marking spot for cats.
                        If s/he bumps his/her head against you (called "bunting"), s/he's marking you as hers.[4]</p>

                <li>
                   <p> Pet the cat's cheeks just behind the whiskers. If the cat likes this, s/he may rotate his/her whiskers forward, effectively asking for more.[5]

                <li>
                    <p>Run the back of your hand gently along the side of the face. Once the cat is warmed up, use your middle finger to stroke the cat's "mustache" (just above the upper lips) while encircling his/her whole face and stroking the top of the head with your thumb. The cat is yours.
